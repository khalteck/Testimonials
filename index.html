                            I recieved a job offer mid-course, and the subjects i learned<br> were current, if not more so, in the company i joined.
                            I honestly feel i got every penny's worth.

                            who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly 
                            thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, i've 
                            successfully switched careers, working as a software engineer at a VR startup."

                    "Before joining the bootcamp, i've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me
                    learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things
                    about the program. T he entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and i never had to wait 
                    long for assistance. The agile team project, in pparticular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a 
                    way that no tutorial could never have. In fact, i've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my development 
                    experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after recieving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"

                    Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their
